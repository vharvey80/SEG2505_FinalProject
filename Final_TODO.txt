Priority List for functionnality:

- MAKE SURE OUR CODE COMPILES (-20%)
    - Not actually a task, just a reminder

- Add task with name and description (8%) -- Walid

- Modify a task (5%) -- Walid

- Delete task (5%)

- Can see obtained points (5%)
    - I assume this means a user can see his total points

- Can list all task assigned to a user (7%)
    - Should be simple. We already see it in user detail Activity. For task list, we can have an onclick for the switch that get a list of task associated to the present user and the resetting the adapter.

- Can list all tasks associated to a group (7%) -- Walid
    - Assigned it to myself because it's already done, it's the TaskFragment and it's view

- Change the state of a task (5%)
    - Assigned/Unassigned it done by assigning and unassigning task. For completed or cancel, I guess we can put buttons on TaskDetailActivity

- Can assing task to user (6%)

- Can unassign task from user (6%)

- Affect ressources to a Task (6%)
    - I assume ressources are tools. This will be tricky, the person that takes this should contact me (Walid) as I've looked into it (since I desinged the task creation dialog) and could be of help.

- Remove ressources from Task (6%)
    - We can either do this in task modification dialog or add a button to each tool in TaskDetailActivity

- See all tools for necessary for all tasks of a group (6%)
    - I guess this is already done, it the ToolActivity

---------BONUS----------

- Authentification of users (+8%)

- Can see all tasks on a calendar (+8%)
